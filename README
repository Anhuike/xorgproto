				X Xinerama Extension

Xinerama is an X extension that allows clients to query information
about multiple physical screens controlled by a single X server that
appear as a single screen to core X11 protocol operations.

This extension provides a common network protocol for querying information
which may be provided by different underlying screen combination
technologies in the X server, such as the original Xinerama multiplexer,
or alternative implementations like Xrandr or TwinView.
