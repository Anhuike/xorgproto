XEvIE - X Event Interception Extension

Extension name: XEVIE

XEvIE is a X extension providing functionalities to allow a client to
intercept keyboard/mouse events, and optionally modify them or consume
them before delivery through the normal event delivery mechanisms.

It was included in X11R6.8 through Xorg server 1.5, but is no
longer supported in current X server releases (and didn't actually
work in the last releases that did include it, nor was it ever enabled
by default in the releases made by X.Org, though some distros may have
enabled it in their builds/packages).

No formal specification of the protocol was ever written, but it can
be mostly determined from the evieproto.h header and the libXevie
documentation of the functions that directly map to the protocol requests.

A version 1.1 was proposed to solve several issues around security and
multi-client access, but never implemented.
